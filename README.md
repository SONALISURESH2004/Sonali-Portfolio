This Personal Portfolio Website designed and developed using HTML, SCSS, JavaScript, and CSS animations to highlight my skills, achievements,
and projects in a visually engaging format. I focused on creating a smooth, interactive user experience with custom transitions, animated elements,
and a responsive layout suitable for all screen sizes. While working on this project, I explored advanced SCSS features for cleaner styling and
implemented JavaScript for interactive sections. I faced several layout and animation challenges, but by troubleshooting consistently, 
I strengthened my frontend development abilities.
This portfolio serves as a professional platform to represent my work and connect with potential employers and collaborators.
